Energy Consumption Viewer (ECV)

## Description

Energy Consumption Viewer is a tool to vizualise the results of the paper: "". 
Energy Consumption Viewer (ECV visually displays the different results of the scientific paper "" using simple progress bars to represent energy
consumption. It provide an equivalence of the energy consumption for each Linux command evaluated in terms of the time of use of
devices such as HDD, GPU, and LED light bulb. A detailed mode is also implemented, the user can access comprehensive information about both energy consumption and time of use for each specific
configuration that has been measured in experiments. This mode provides in-depth insights into the energy consumption and time of use of devices by configuration.
Therefore, with ECV, understanding energy consumption of configurations becomes much more straightforward for developers and end-users. It provides two usage scenarios one for
developers and one for end-users. On the one hand, developers of utilities in configurable systems can use our tool to measure their energy consumption and monitor it as they evolve their utilities
